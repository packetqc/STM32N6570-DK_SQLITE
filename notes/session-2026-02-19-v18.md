# Session 2026-02-19 — Knowledge Autonomy v18 Update

## What happened
- Read `packetqc/knowledge` CLAUDE.md — v18 (current)
- Satellite was at v11, now updated to v18
- Ran full wakeup protocol
- 7 evolution entries absorbed (v12 through v18)

## Key protocol changes since v11
- v12-v15: `claude/knowledge` branch protocol (designed, tested, validated)
- v16: Cross-repo push discovery — proxy scopes push per-repo
- v17: Proxy reality — push scoped to **exact assigned branch only**, not all `claude/*` branches. Semi-automatic protocol: Claude commits + pushes to task branch + creates PR, user approves
- v18: `main` replaces `claude/knowledge` as convergence branch. Two branch types: `main` (PR-gated) + `claude/<task-id>` (ephemeral). Maximum simplification.

## Protocol understanding
- Claude Code pushes to assigned `claude/<task-id>` branch only
- PR targets `main` (the default branch)
- User approves PR to merge — single manual step
- `harvest` reads from `main`
- No intermediate protocol branches needed

## Project state
- 4 commits on master (initial + delete scratch + bootstrap PR merge + bootstrap commit)
- Core pipeline code in `MPLIB-CODE/MPLIB_STORAGE.cpp/.h`
- Full architecture docs in `doc/readme.md`
- SQLite amalgamation in `SQLite/`
- No active development besides knowledge sync

## Harvest flags
- No new project insights this session (knowledge sync only)

## Knowledge status
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Bootstrap | active (v18) |
| Session persistence | active |
| Protocol | semi-automatic (v17/v18) |
| Convergence branch | `main` |
| Own knowledge | rich (doc/readme.md) |
