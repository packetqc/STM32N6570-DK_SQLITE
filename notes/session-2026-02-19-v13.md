# Session 2026-02-19 — Knowledge Autonomy v13 Update

## What happened
- Wakeup with knowledge v13 (core read via public HTTPS)
- Satellite was at v11, 2 versions behind (missing v12 knowledge branch protocol, v13 public HTTPS + auto-creation)
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` knowledge-version tag from v11 to v13
- Created `notes/healthcheck.json` for autonomous self-healthcheck protocol
- Satellite now aligned with core v13 — drift = 0

## Version gap closed
- **v12**: Knowledge branch protocol — bidirectional flow via `knowledge` branch, PR + merge on every change
- **v13**: Public HTTPS repo access — all access via `https://github.com/packetqc/<repo>`, `knowledge` branch auto-created from `main` if missing

## Project state
- Core pipeline code in MPLIB-CODE/ unchanged
- Full architecture docs in doc/readme.md
- SQLite amalgamation in SQLite/
- No live/ tooling deployed yet
- No PLAN.md

## Harvest flags
- cache sizing pattern (81% degradation at 4M rows)
- printf latency (1-5 ms per call at 115200 baud)
- page cache slot size mismatch (page_size + 256, not just page_size)
- SQLITE_CONFIG ordering (must be before sqlite3_initialize)

## Knowledge status
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Bootstrap | active (v13) |
| Session persistence | active |
| Live tooling | missing |
| Own knowledge | rich (doc/readme.md, 4 project-specific pitfalls) |
| Publications | #1 already published from this satellite |
| Drift | 0 (aligned with core v13) |
