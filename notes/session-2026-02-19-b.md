# Session 2026-02-19-b — Wakeup v14

## What happened
- Read `packetqc/knowledge` CLAUDE.md — sunglasses on (v14)
- Full wakeup protocol on branch `claude/knowledge-autonomy-v14-Bxp6Q`
- Updated satellite knowledge-version tag from v11 to v14
- Previous session: bootstrap (v11), created CLAUDE.md and notes/

## Knowledge delta (v11 -> v14)
- v12: Knowledge branch protocol — `claude/knowledge` branch for autonomous push
- v13: Public HTTPS repo access + autonomous branch creation
- v14: `claude/knowledge` replaces `knowledge` — naming convention IS the permission model

## Project state
- 4 commits on main (initial + delete scratch + bootstrap PR merge + bootstrap commit)
- Core pipeline code: `MPLIB-CODE/MPLIB_STORAGE.cpp/.h`
- Architecture docs: `doc/readme.md`
- SQLite amalgamation: `SQLite/`
- No live tooling deployed yet
- No active development beyond bootstrap

## Harvest flags
- (none yet — awaiting user direction)
