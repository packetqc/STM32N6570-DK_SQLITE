# Session 2026-02-19 — Bootstrap + v19 Update

## What happened
- Read `packetqc/knowledge` CLAUDE.md — sunglasses on (v11)
- Read methodology, patterns, lessons, and minds
- Ran full wakeup protocol
- Satellite status: v0 (pre-bootstrap), 11 versions behind core
- No prior sessions, no notes, no CLAUDE.md, no live tooling

## Bootstrap actions
- Created `CLAUDE.md` with knowledge v11 bootstrap tag
- Created `notes/` folder with this session file
- Project is now bootstrapped — next wakeup will self-sustain

## v19 Update (session 2)
- Re-read `packetqc/knowledge` CLAUDE.md — core now at v19
- Updated satellite `CLAUDE.md` knowledge-version: v11 → v19
- Updated wakeup instructions: added git clone + WebFetch fallback, `gh` prohibition
- Key v17-v19 changes absorbed:
  - v17: Proxy reality — semi-automatic protocol (push scoped to assigned branch only)
  - v18: `main` replaces `claude/knowledge` as convergence branch
  - v19: Todo list must mirror full save protocol (write notes, commit, push, create PR)

## Project state
- 2 commits on main (initial commit + delete mx.scratch)
- Core pipeline code exists in `MPLIB-CODE/MPLIB_STORAGE.cpp/.h`
- Full architecture docs in `doc/readme.md`
- SQLite amalgamation in `SQLite/`
- Working on branch `claude/knowledge-autonomy-v19-FEFLR`

## Harvest flags
- No new insights this session (version alignment only)
