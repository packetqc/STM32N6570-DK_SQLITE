# Session 2026-02-19 — Bootstrap

## What happened
- Read `packetqc/knowledge` CLAUDE.md — sunglasses on (v11)
- Read methodology, patterns, lessons, and minds
- Ran full wakeup protocol
- Satellite status: v0 (pre-bootstrap), 11 versions behind core
- No prior sessions, no notes, no CLAUDE.md, no live tooling

## Bootstrap actions
- Created `CLAUDE.md` with knowledge v11 bootstrap tag
- Created `notes/` folder with this session file
- Project is now bootstrapped — next wakeup will self-sustain

## Project state
- 2 commits on main (initial commit + delete mx.scratch)
- Core pipeline code exists in `MPLIB-CODE/MPLIB_STORAGE.cpp/.h`
- Full architecture docs in `doc/readme.md`
- SQLite amalgamation in `SQLite/`
- No active development branches prior to this session

## Harvest flags
- No new insights this session (bootstrap only)
