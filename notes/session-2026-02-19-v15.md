# Session 2026-02-19 — Knowledge v15 Update

## Context
- Previous session: Bootstrap (v11)
- Wakeup triggered: read full packetqc/knowledge repository
- Core knowledge version: v15
- Satellite was at: v11 (4 versions behind)

## What happened
- Full wakeup protocol executed — sunglasses on
- Read all knowledge layers: CLAUDE.md, methodology/, patterns/, lessons/, minds/
- Read satellite harvest file (minds/stm32n6570-dk-sqlite.md) — 8 evolved patterns, 4 pitfalls, 6 promotion candidates
- Read all session notes from previous bootstrap

## Changes made
- Updated CLAUDE.md knowledge version tag: v11 → v15
- Updated bootstrap section with v15 three-tier access protocol (clone → WebFetch claude/knowledge → WebFetch main fallback)
