ITTIA DB EVALUATION LICENSE AGREEMENT
=====================================

THIS IS A BINDING LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ITTIA L.L.C. FOR THE
ACCOMPANYING ITTIA DATABASE SOFTWARE AND ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION FOR
TIME-LIMITED EVALUATION. BY DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING, YOU (ON BEHALF
OF YOURSELF OR AS AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ON BEHALF OF AN
ENTITY) AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT
REGARDING YOUR USE OF THE DATABASE SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DELETE
AND DESTROY THE DATABASE SOFTWARE AND DO NOT PROCEED.

1.  NOTICE. This is a legal evaluation license ("Agreement") between you
    ("LICENSEE") and ITTIA L.L.C, a Washington Limited Liability Company
    ("ITTIA"). By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Database
    Software accompanying this Agreement, which includes computer
    software and "online" or electronic documentation, associated media,
    benchmarks, and printed materials, you agree to be bound by the
    terms and conditions of this Agreement. The right to use the
    Database Software is time limited. All rights granted to LICENSEE in
    this Agreement will be void after the end of the evaluation period,
    which is no later than 45 days after LICENSEE received the Database
    Software.

2.  SUBJECT MATTER OF THE LICENSE. This Agreement is a novation of all
    prior agreements, and integration of all proposals and
    representations between ITTIA and LICENSEE, regarding all ITTIA
    software in your possession for evaluation, including the contents
    of any sealed media package(s), earlier releases of the software,
    all accompanying written materials, whether contained in manuals,
    sealed media package(s) or otherwise (hereafter referred to as
    "Database Software").

3.  LICENSE TO EVALUATE. ITTIA grants LICENSEE a limited, non-exclusive,
    non-assignable, non-transferable license to make and use copies of
    the Database Software for the sole purpose of evaluating the
    Database Software. This license offers the right to evaluate the
    Database Software for the development of computer programs in
    compiled, linked, executable form ("Product"), provided the Product
    that includes the Database Software does not constitute a database
    management system that could be used to commercially compete with
    the Database Software. LICENSEE shall not use the Database Software,
    or any portion thereof, for any production or commercial purpose,
    only for evaluation. LICENSEE shall not distribute this software, in
    any form, to any third party for any reason unless this distribution
    is specifically approved by ITTIA in writing.

4.  BENCHMARK TESTING. LICENSEE shall not disclose the results of any
    benchmark test of the Database Software to any third party without
    ITTIA's prior written approval. Benchmark testing shall be performed
    only for LICENSEES’ internal analysis and decision-making and shall
    not be done on behalf of any third parties nor for any other
    reasons.

5.  OTHER RESTRICTIONS. The license(s) granted herein are personal to
    the LICENSEE specified during the evaluation period. The LICENSEE
    may be an individual or organization. The LICENSEE may be a division
    or subsidiary of a larger organization or the affiliate of a smaller
    organization. Additional licenses for development and distribution
    by the LICENSEE or its affiliates must be separately obtained from
    ITTIA. LICENSEE may not develop (beyond prototypes), use, reproduce,
    modify, distribute, disclose, or transfer the Database Software
    except as allowed by this license Agreement. LICENSEE may not sell,
    sublicense, rent, lease, assign, give, or otherwise transfer any
    part of the Database Software or this license. LICENSEE may not
    retain copies, even of prior versions of the Database Software,
    after the termination of this license. LICENSEE's obligations under
    this Agreement survive any termination of the licenses granted by
    this Agreement. You shall not distribute any software statically or
    dynamically linked with the Database Software.

6.  REVERSE ENGINEERING. As the LICENSEE, you shall not reverse
    engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Database Software, or
    otherwise attempt to discover the source code, if provided, of the
    Database Software, except where expressly permitted by the
    applicable law to obtain compatibility with other software programs,
    and only after prior written notification and approval by ITTIA.

7.  DATABASE SOFTWARE ACCESS. Access to the Database Software shall be
    limited to employees and contractors of LICENSEE who require access
    to the Database Software for the purposes of evaluation and will
    ensure the confidentiality of any information they garner during the
    evaluation. LICENSEE agrees that any breach by any employee or
    contractor of such employee's and contractor's obligations under
    this confidentiality clause shall also constitute a breach by
    LICENSEE hereunder. LICENSEE shall maintain and, upon ITTIA's
    reasonable request, provide to ITTIA, the names of all employees and
    contractors who have had access to the Database Software.

8.  OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The Database Software is
    owned by ITTIA and is protected by national intellectual laws and
    international treaty provisions. The Database Software contains
    proprietary information. Therefore, you must protect the Database
    Software like any other material protected by intellectual property
    laws (such as copyright, patent, and/or trade secret), ensuring that
    anyone with access to the Database Software refrains from
    unauthorized reproduction, use, or disclosure. ITTIA retains all
    rights not expressly granted. No title, property rights, or
    copyright in the Database Software or in any modifications to the
    Database Software shall pass to the LICENSEE under any
    circumstances. LICENSEE may not remove, obscure, or alter any
    copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, confidential, or other
    proprietary notices on or in the Database Software. If provided,
    ITTIA DB Console is a supplementary license for the Database
    Software and includes free open-source third-party components.

9.  TERMINATION. This license is granted for evaluation purposes only.
    All grants of license herein expire 45 days after receiving the
    Database Software. After this date, you must either purchase the
    software license with the appropriate license agreement, request and
    receive an extension of this evaluation license from ITTIA or
    destroy all copies of the Database Software and all derivative
    works. The license granted herein may also be terminated by
    returning or destroying all copies of the Database Software
    materials within your control and so notifying ITTIA in writing. The
    above licenses, including your right to use the Database Software,
    will terminate automatically if you infringe ITTIA copyrights or
    breach this Agreement. Termination of your licenses does not affect
    your obligations under this Agreement.

10. EXPORT AND COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND POLICIES. LICENSEE agrees to
    comply with all applicable laws, regulations, rulings, and executive
    orders and any other applicable jurisdictions including but not
    limited to those relating to the export or re-export of the Database
    Software, and with all applicable international laws which must be
    complied with in order to protect or preserve ITTIA's copyright(s),
    trade secrets(s) and other Intellectual Proprietary Rights in and to
    the Database Software.

11. WARRANTY. THE DATABASE SOFTWARE FOR EVALUATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS"
    AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ITTIA DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
    WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO ORAL OR
    WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY ITTIA, ITS DEALERS,
    DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY
    WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY AND THE LICENSEE MAY NOT
    RELY ON ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR ADVICE.

12. LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION. In no event shall ITTIA’s liability
    arising out of this agreement exceed the aggregate amount received
    by ITTIA from LICENSEE under this Agreement. THE WARRANTY AND
    LIABILITY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF
    THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN ITTIA AND THE LICENSEE. ITTIA WOULD
    NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE DATABASE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH
    LIMITATIONS.

13. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The parties agree that
    Confidential Information shall mean information covering the
    following: (i) pricing of the Database Software (ii) the Database
    Software, (iii) the technology, ideas, know-how, documentation,
    processes, algorithms, and trade secrets or associated trademarks
    with the Database Software, (iv) the LICENSEE's project and business
    details, disclosed by either of the parties to the other party under
    this Agreement. Both parties agree to maintain Confidential
    Information in confidence by using a reasonable degree of care in
    order to ensure that no unauthorized persons shall have access to
    the Confidential Information. The parties agree that the terms of
    this section shall continue in full force and effect irrespective of
    the expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of
    five (5) years from the Effective Date (as specified below) of this
    Agreement unless otherwise specified in a future agreement between
    the parties. ITTIA and LICENSEE further agree that each party shall
    protect the existence and terms of this Agreement, including
    information about the evaluation of the Database Software in
    LICENSEE's business and terms around such use, as Confidential
    Information. Confidential Information shall not include that
    information which (i) becomes part of the public domain through no
    breach by any of the parties; (ii) is independently developed
    without the use of Confidential Information; or (iii) is rightfully
    disclosed by a third party.

14. TECHNICAL SUPPORT. During the evaluation period, technical support
    by email and telephone is available on a first-come, first-served,
    best efforts basis.

15. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Database Software and related
    documentation are provided with restricted rights. Use, duplication,
    or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions. The
    Database software provided under this Agreement is commercial
    computer software programs and documentation developed exclusively
    at private expense. When Database Software is acquired by or on
    behalf of the Department of Defense, use, disclosure, modification,
    distribution, and reproduction are subject to the standard
    limitations and restrictions set forth in the body of this
    Agreement, and as permitted by DFAR 227.7202-1. If Database Software
    is acquired by other U.S. Government agencies or on their behalf,
    the Database Software is furnished with Limited and Restricted
    Rights as otherwise set forth herein, or as set forth in FAR
    52.227-19(b)(1) and (2) as may be required.

16. SEVERABILITY. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
    shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be valid and effective
    under applicable law. If any provision is invalid, the remaining
    provisions remain enforceable.

17. LAW AND JURISDICTION. The governing law for this Agreement is the
    law of California State, the U.S.A. and any disputes which have not
    been capable of resolution by friendly negotiation shall be brought
    before the Federal Courts in Orange County, California State, USA.
    The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods
    does not apply to this Agreement. Any controversy or claim arising
    out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall
    be settled by binding arbitration in Orange County, California under
    the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
    Association by one arbitrator appointed in accordance with said
    rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
    entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, the parties may apply to any court of competent
    jurisdiction for injunctive relief without breach of this
    arbitration provision. If any provision or provisions of this
    Agreement are determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable,
    the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining
    provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or
    impaired thereby. The prevailing party in such a proceeding will be
    entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including reasonable
    attorney's fees.

       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

SIL Open Font License

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
